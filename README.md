Lab1 : Autoregressive models

In this lab we builded autoregressive models for a data set corresponding to the Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) over the past few decades. 

Lab2 ï¼šStructural model, Kalman filtering and EM

In this lab we analysed data using a structural time series model. First set up a model and implement a Kalman filter to infer the latet states of the model, as well doing long-term prediction. Then implement a disturbance smoother and an expectation maximization algorithm to tune the parameters of the model. 

Lab3 : Nonlinear state space models and Sequential Monte Carlo

In this lab we made use of a non-linear state space model for analyzing the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing covid-19. We will use an epidemiological model referred to as a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. It is a stochastic adaptation of the model used by the The Public Health Agency of Sweden for predicting the spread of covid-19 in the Stockholm region early in the pandemic

Lab4 : Recurrent Neural Networks

This lab is to explore different RNN models and training procedures for a problem in time series prediction.
